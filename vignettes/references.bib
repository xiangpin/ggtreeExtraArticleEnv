The accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated on several real-world data sets and compared with placement by pair-wise sequence comparison, using edit distances and BLAST. We introduce a slow and accurate as well as a fast and less accurate placement algorithm. For the slow algorithm, we develop additional heuristic techniques that yield almost the same run times as the fast version with only a small loss of accuracy. When those additional heuristics are employed, the run time of the more accurate algorithm is comparable with that of a simple BLAST search for data sets with a high number of short query sequences. Moreover, the accuracy of the EPA is significantly higher, in particular when the sample of taxa in the reference topology is sparse or inadequate. Our algorithm, which has been integrated into RAxML, therefore provides an equally fast but more accurate alternative to BLAST for tree-based inference of the evolutionary origin and composition of short sequence reads. We are also actively developing a Web server that offers a freely available service for computing read placements on trees using the EPA.}",

Since the last {RAxML} paper in 2006, it has been continuously maintained and extended to accommodate the increasingly growing input datasets and to serve the needs of the user community.
Results: I present some of the most notable new features and extensions of {RAxML}, such as, a substantial extension of substitution models and supported data types, the introduction of {SSE}3, {AVX}, and {AVX}2 vector intrinsics, techniques for reducing the memory requirements of the code and a plethora of operations for conducting post-analyses on sets of trees. In addition, an up-to-date, 50 page user manual covering all new {RAxML} options is available.

We recently developed a coalescent-based method, {ASTRAL}, which is statistically consistent under the multi-species coalescent model and which is more accurate than other coalescent-based methods on the datasets we examined. {ASTRAL} runs in polynomial time, by constraining the search space using a set of allowed 'bipartitions'. Despite the limitation to allowed bipartitions, {ASTRAL} is statistically consistent.
{RESULTS}: We present a new version of {ASTRAL}, which we call {ASTRAL}-{II}. We show that {ASTRAL}-{II} has substantial advantages over {ASTRAL}: it is faster, can analyze much larger datasets (up to 1000 species and 1000 genes) and has substantially better accuracy under some conditions. {ASTRAL}'s running time is [Formula: see text], and {ASTRAL}-{II}'s running time is [Formula: see text], where n is the number of species, k is the number of loci and X is the set of allowed bipartitions for the search space.

We present a new probabilistic model to jointly infer rooted species and gene trees for dozens of genomes and thousands of gene families. We use simulations to show that this method accurately infers the species tree and gene trees, is robust to misspecification of the models of sequence and gene family evolution, and provides a precise historic record of gene duplications and losses throughout genome evolution. We simultaneously reconstruct the history of mammalian species and their genes based on 36 completely sequenced genomes, and use the reconstructed gene trees to infer the gene content and organization of ancestral mammalian genomes.

Consequently, users of these software packages are simultaneously forced to use a number of programs for a given study, while also lacking the freedom to explore models that have not been implemented by the developers of those programs. We developed a new open-source software package, RevBayes, to address these problems. RevBayes is entirely based on probabilistic graphical models, a powerful generic framework for specifying and analyzing statistical models. Phylogenetic-graphical models can be speciﬁed interactively in RevBayes, piece by piece, using a new succinct and intuitive language called Rev. Rev is similar to the R language and the BUGS model-speciﬁcation language, and should be easy to learn for most users. The strength of RevBayes is the simplicity with which one can design, specify, and implement new and complex models. Fortunately, this tremendous ﬂexibility does not come at the cost of slower computation; as we demonstrate, RevBayes outperforms competing software for several standard analyses. Compared with other programs, RevBayes has fewer black-box elements. Users need to explicitly specify each part of the model and analysis. Although this explicitness may initially be unfamiliar, we are convinced that this transparency will improve understanding of phylogenetic models in our ﬁeld. Moreover, it will motivate the search for improvements to existing methods by brazenly exposing the model choices that we make to critical scrutiny.

    abstract = {Objective To investigate whether diets differing in fat content alter the gut microbiota and faecal metabolomic profiles, and to determine their relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy adults whose diet is in a transition from a traditional low-fat diet to a diet high in fat and reduced in carbohydrate.Methods In a 6-month randomised controlled-feeding trial, 217 healthy young adults (aged 18{\textendash}35 years; body mass index \&lt;28 kg/m2; 52\% women) who completed the whole trial were included. All the foods were provided during the intervention period. The three isocaloric diets were: a lower-fat diet (fat 20\% energy), a moderate-fat diet (fat 30\% energy) and a higher-fat diet (fat 40\% energy). The effects of the dietary interventions on the gut microbiota, faecal metabolomics and plasma inflammatory factors were investigated.Results The lower-fat diet was associated with increased α-diversity assessed by the Shannon index (p=0.03), increased abundance of Blautia (p=0.007) and Faecalibacterium (p=0.04), whereas the higher-fat diet was associated with increased Alistipes (p=0.04), Bacteroides (p\&lt;0.001) and decreased Faecalibacterium (p=0.04). The concentration of total short-chain fatty acids was significantly decreased in the higher-fat diet group in comparison with the other groups (p\&lt;0.001). The cometabolites p-cresol and indole, known to be associated with host metabolic disorders, were decreased in the lower-fat diet group. In addition, the higher-fat diet was associated with faecal enrichment in arachidonic acid and the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway as well as elevated plasma proinflammatory factors after the intervention.Conclusion Higher-fat consumption by healthy young adults whose diet is in a state of nutrition transition appeared to be associated with unfavourable changes in gut microbiota, faecal metabolomic profiles and plasma proinflammatory factors, which might confer adverse consequences for long-term health outcomes.Trial registration number NCT02355795; Results.},

    abstract = {Diet and host phylogeny drive the taxonomic and functional contents of the gut microbiome in mammals, yet it is unknown whether these patterns hold across all vertebrate lineages. Here, we assessed gut microbiomes from \~{}900 vertebrate species, including 315 mammals and 491 birds, assessing contributions of diet, phylogeny, and physiology to structuring gut microbiomes. In most nonflying mammals, strong correlations exist between microbial community similarity, host diet, and host phylogenetic distance up to the host order level. In birds, by contrast, gut microbiomes are only very weakly correlated to diet or host phylogeny. Furthermore, while most microbes resident in mammalian guts are present in only a restricted taxonomic range of hosts, most microbes recovered from birds show little evidence of host specificity. Notably, among the mammals, bats host especially bird-like gut microbiomes, with little evidence for correlation to host diet or phylogeny. This suggests that host-gut microbiome phylosymbiosis depends on factors convergently absent in birds and bats, potentially associated with physiological adaptations to flight. Our findings expose major variations in the behavior of these important symbioses in endothermic vertebrates and may signal fundamental evolutionary shifts in the cost/benefit framework of the gut microbiome.IMPORTANCE In this comprehensive survey of microbiomes of \&gt;900 species, including 315 mammals and 491 birds, we find a striking convergence of the microbiomes of birds and animals that fly. In nonflying mammals, diet and short-term evolutionary relatedness drive the microbiome, and many microbial species are specific to a particular kind of mammal, but flying mammals and birds break this pattern with many microbes shared across different species, with little correlation either with diet or with relatedness of the hosts. This finding suggests that adaptation to flight breaks long-held relationships between hosts and their microbes.},

Molecular dating has enhanced our understanding of the temporal patterns of species divergences over the last five decades, and the number of studies is increasing quickly due to an exponential growth in the available collection of molecular sequences from diverse species and large number of genes. Our TimeTree resource is a public knowledge-base with the primary focus to make available all species divergence times derived using molecular sequence data to scientists, educators, and the general public in a consistent and accessible format. Here, we report a major expansion of the TimeTree resource, which more than triples the number of species (\\&gt;97,000) and more than triples the number of studies assembled (\\&gt;3,000). Furthermore, scientists can access not only the divergence time between two species or higher taxa, but also a timetree of a group of species and a timeline that traces a species’ evolution through time. The new timetree and timeline visualizations are integrated with display of events on earth and environmental history over geological time, which will lead to broader and better understanding of the interplay of the change in the biosphere with the diversity of species on Earth.

Changes in the amount of fibrillarins in cells can lead to incorrect translation of proteins, and is associated with various types of cancer as well as bacterial and viral responses. To date, no formal analysis of the evolution of fibrillarins through different groups of organisms such as prokaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals exists. Next-generation sequencing enhances the accessibility of great number of genome sequences from different organisms. The aim of this work is to detect the sequence stability of the fibrillarin gene copies on distant related organisms, and whether it could be associated to the changes on the organization of their genome structures. We applied a novel methodology to detect rearrangements on genomes and found evidence of evolutionary forces on plants that keep the genome region where fibrillarin is located conserved. Also, we observed that a duplication of fibrillarin occurred in mammals which led to novel or specific functions of fibrillarin duplicates.},

Molecular phylogenetics has been crucial to resolving broad relationships of sleepers and gobies (Gobioidei), but the phylogenetic placements of cardinalfishes and nurseryfishes, as reciprocal or sequential sister clades to Gobioidei, are uncertain. In order to evaluate relationships among and within families we used a phylogenetic data mining approach to generate densely sampled trees inclusive of all higher taxa. We utilized conspecific amino acid homology to improve alignment accuracy, included ambiguously identified taxa to increase taxon sampling density, and resampled individual gene alignments to filter rogue sequences before concatenation. This approach yielded the most comprehensive tree yet of Gobiaria, inferred from a sparse (17 percent-complete) supermatrix of one ribosomal and 22 protein coding loci (18,065 characters), comprised of 50 outgroup and 777 ingroup taxa, representing 32 percent of species and 68 percent of genera. Our analyses confirmed the lineage-based classification of gobies with strong support, identified sleeper clades with unforeseen levels of systematic uncertainty, and quantified competing phylogenetic signals that confound resolution of the root topology. We also discovered that multilocus data completeness was related to maximum likelihood branch support, and verified that the phylogenetic uncertainty of shallow relationships observed within goby lineages could largely be explained by supermatrix sparseness. These results demonstrate the potential and limits of publicly available sequence data for producing densely-sampled phylogenetic trees of exceptionally biodiverse groups."

We designed and screened CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2. This approach effectively reduced H1N1 IAV load in respiratory epithelial cells. Our bioinformatic analysis showed that a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. With the development of a safe and effective system for respiratory tract delivery, PAC-MAN has the potential to become an important pan-coronavirus inhibition strategy."

    abstract = {Ggtree supports mapping and visualizing associated external data on phylogeny with two general methods. The output of ggtree is a ggtree graphic object that can be rendered as a static image. Most importantly, the input tree and associated data that used in visualization can be extracted from the graphic object, making it an ideal data structure for publishing tree (image, tree and data in one single object) and thus enhance data reuse and analytic reproducibility.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
